# E9-Business-Intelligence-Specialist-Assignment

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing equipment data to uncover trends, seasonal patterns, and significant insights using Python. The analysis leverages time series decomposition and statistical methods to understand the dynamics of equipment usage over time, providing valuable business intelligence insights.

## Files in the Repository

- **`equipment_data.csv`**: Contains raw data on equipment usage, including various variables relevant to the analysis.
- **`leads_data.csv`**: Includes lead information that may be correlated with equipment usage patterns.
- **`users_data.csv`**: Contains user data, useful for segmenting and refining the analysis.
- **`E9-Business Intelligence Specialist-Monu Kaushik.ipynb`**: Documentation of the project, including the code and outputs used in the analysis.

## Analysis and Methods

### 1. Time Series Decomposition

We conducted a time series decomposition on the equipment data using the `statsmodels` library in Python. This decomposition helped us break down the data into three key components:
- **Trend**: The long-term direction of equipment usage.
- **Seasonality**: Regular patterns that repeat over specific periods.
- **Residuals**: The random noise remaining after removing trend and seasonality.

This analysis was crucial in isolating seasonal effects and understanding the overall trend in equipment usage.

### 2. Business Intelligence Insights

The analysis provided several key business insights, such as:
- Identification of peak usage periods, aiding in better resource allocation and inventory management.
- Detection of seasonal patterns that could influence sales strategies and promotional activities.

## Key Results

- **Trend Analysis**: A consistent upward trend in equipment usage was identified, indicating increasing demand.
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Significant seasonal effects were observed, with certain months showing higher usage.
- **Scenario Impact**: Business scenarios were modeled to demonstrate how changes in market conditions could affect equipment usage.

## Conclusion

This project offers deep insights into equipment usage trends and seasonal patterns, supporting more informed decision-making in areas like inventory management and resource planning. The scenarios presented provide a solid framework for forecasting future trends under varying business conditions.
