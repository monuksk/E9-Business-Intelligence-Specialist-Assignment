# E9-Business-Intelligence-Specialist-Assignment

## Overview

This project involves analyzing equipment data using Python to uncover trends, seasonal patterns, and other significant insights. The analysis utilizes time series decomposition and other statistical methods to better understand the dynamics of equipment usage over time.

## Files in the Repository

- **`equipment_data.csv`**: Contains raw data related to equipment usage and other variables relevant to the analysis.
- **`leads_data.csv`**: Includes lead information that may correlate with equipment data.
- **`users_data.csv`**: User information, potentially useful for segmenting the analysis.
- **`EQUIP9 - Monu Kaushik.html`**: Documentation of the project, including the code and outputs used in the analysis. 
- **`E9-BIS-Scenario.pdf`**: A report outlining business intelligence scenarios derived from the analysis.

## Analysis and Methods

### 1. Time Series Decomposition

We performed a time series decomposition on the equipment data using the statsmodels library in Python. The decomposition helped identify the following components:
- **Trend**: Long-term direction in the data.
- **Seasonality**: Repeating short-term cycles in the data.
- **Residuals**: Random noise after removing trend and seasonality.

This analysis was particularly useful for isolating seasonal effects and understanding the underlying trend in equipment usage.

### 2. Business Intelligence Insights

Based on the analysis, several key business insights were derived, including:
- Identification of peak usage periods, which can inform resource allocation and inventory management.
- Seasonal patterns that could impact sales strategies and promotional activities.

### 3. Scenario Analysis

Using the information in the `E9-BIS-Scenario.pdf`, we developed scenarios that simulate various business conditions and their potential impact on equipment usage. These scenarios help in strategic planning and decision-making.

## Key Results

- **Trend Analysis**: A clear upward trend in equipment usage was identified, indicating growing demand.
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Significant seasonal effects were found, with higher usage in specific months.
- **Scenario Impact**: Various business scenarios were modeled, demonstrating how changes in market conditions could affect equipment usage.

## Conclusion

The project provides valuable insights into equipment usage trends and seasonal patterns, enabling better decision-making in inventory management and resource planning. The scenarios outlined offer a robust framework for forecasting future trends under different business conditions.
